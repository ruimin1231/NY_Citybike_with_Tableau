# **Bike-sharing program in Des Moines**

---

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate the usage of Citi Bike in NYC via visualization, so that it could help to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines could be a solid proposal.


## Results

In general, majority of the bike rental's duration was less than 60 minutes, and the rental duration reached to its peak where 4 billion bike-usages were completed at around 10 minutes. The bike-sharing program is really sloving the "last-mile" problrm for the community.

- After reviewed the bike-usage in NYC, it would be interesting to see if gender was a factor in rental program. As the following figure showed, male users were almost triple of famel users in the peak. If the riding experience improved for female users, the rental usage could be growning even further.

- In the rush hours, 7 to 9 am and 5 to 7 pm, the rentals were extremely busy as people were commuting to work. However, over the weekend, the rentals were spread out during the entire day time, shown as following figure.

- The comparirson indicated the company had to provide some sort of extra daily service to balance out the differences. The bike needed to be ready in the popular starting point, but need to be collected in the popular ending point.
  
## Summary

There are a lot of more male than female who would like to use the citi-bike on their daily basis, and majority of them become subscribers. However, this analysis did not include some important factors, like population density, weather condition, city culture, household income, city layout etc. It could not really predict if this bike-sharing program would be sucessful model for Des Moine. Therefore, I would like to collecting more data in these 5 factors mentioned above, until then, I could not predict if this program is suitable to be duplicated in other place.
